# Archive SDK

The Archive SDK allows for working with various archive formats, ZIP, TAR, etc. on the JVM. The standout feature is
strong encryption support for ZIP files.

## License key
The Archive SDK requires a license key. Contact [PKWARE Sales and Support](mailto:sales@pkware.com) for your key if you
